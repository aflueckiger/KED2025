Starting with basics may be dry stuff; however, it will allow you to use third-party libraries and get a handle on more sophisticated NLP analyses later on."

Without interesting data, these tools are neat but of little use. Thus, we turn to relevant data sources for computational text analysis. When dealing with plain text, your tools will cut through the data like butter. For other formats, such as PDF, we learn some tricks to convert them into plain text. In particular, we use optical character recognition (OCR)."

Unfortunately, it also exhibits severe and poorly understood biases that may cause harm. With the recent turn to data-driven deep learning, NLP overcame many theoretical limitations, but this comes at a cost. It is our duty to better understand the workings and impact of this technology."

In such an exploratory endeavor, using an interactive and visual mode is very effective and complements statistics. In short, we finally arrived at the serious stuff in our journey. To make sure you don’t get lost in the forest of yet unknown concepts, you will also learn some more jargon of NLP."

    "text": "In this hands-on seminar, bachelor students of social and cultural sciences learn the basics of programming, among other essential technical skills. Building on a modern technology stack, it aims to prepare students to conduct data-driven text analysis and to make everyday life easier by fostering technological fundamentals. While learning about the importance of computation in solving problems, we also discuss the current developments in information technology. In short, the course promotes digital literacy on a practical and theoretical level.\nThis seminar focuses on the computational processing of digital and digitized texts using Python and the command-line. For any empirical research, the systematic preparation and aggregation of data and the swift retrieval of information are critical. These tasks require the handling of various data forms, including data that is not yet structured in a tabular format. The seminar covers the complete workflow, from gathering textual data to analyzing an entire text collection to producing interactive visualizations. Sounds cool? It certainly is.\nAlong the way, we deal with questions like these:\n\nHow can extensive collections of texts be evaluated quantitatively in order to strengthen content analysis?\nHow has the discourse on a topic changed over time and how does communication between various actors differ?\nWhat are regular expressions and why are they so useful for text analytical applications?\n\n Go toUniLu website\n Get course syllabus as PDF\n\n\n\n Back to top"
