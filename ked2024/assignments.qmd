You have to submit two assignments to complete the seminar successfully. The purpose of the assignments is not to make the course hard to pass but rather to foster your engagement with the topics covered.

# Mini-Project

You conduct a small computational text analysis and present the results in the final session. To give as many options as possible, you are free to choose your research question as well as the computational methods and data you will use. Working with data from your area of interest is certainly more fun.

This project doesn't aim to overwhelm students with requirements that are too ambitious. It should be the other way around. You will have as much freedom as you need to engage with your data creatively. The goal is that you realize that your knowledge is already good enough to perform powerful analyses. Complementing your claims with quantitative facts about the data is the only requirement.

More information will be provided later in the course.

# Optional Seminar Paper

You are welcomed to write an optional seminar paper (Hauptseminararbeit) for which you get additional credit points. As I am in the position of a guest lecturer, I will accept seminar papers in cooperation with [Prof. Sophie Mützel](https://www.unilu.ch/fakultaeten/ksf/institute/soziologisches-seminar/mitarbeitende/sophie-muetzel/).

Due to the practical foundation of this seminar, you are well-prepared to subsequently apply computational text methods in a personal project. Although this is not a requirement, you may want to turn your mini-project into a seminar paper by deepening your empirical inquiry.

Students planning to write a seminar paper should send me an email with a short outline of their research idea until **15 May 2024** at the latest. When you would like to discuss your idea in person, feel free to do so any time after the seminar.

Requirements for the seminar paper (Hauptseminararbeit):

-   Write your thesis in German or English.
-   Use any computational methods to analyze your data.
-   Your paper has a theoretical question guiding your methodical approach. In other words, methods are a means, not an end in themselves.
-   Formal: 15 pages (A4), 12 pt Times New Roman, 3cm margin, 1.5 line spacing.
-   Deadline for submitting the final paper: **31 August 2024**.
